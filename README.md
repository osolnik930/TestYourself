# TestYourself
This is a python program that helps you study.
It reads a text (.txt) file that has questions in it. Then it asks you a random question and tracks if you knew the answer.
Program keeps track of your success (%), time of answering a question, overall time of studying, study progress and remembers the questions you already answered correctly.

Before using read "example.txt". You can also use it for the first time to see how stuff works.

Enjoy.
